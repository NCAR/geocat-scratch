# GeoCAT Scratch

## How to use this repository
Whatever works for you. Feel free to push to main or make your own branch. Make your own folder, contribute to one of the premade folders corresponding to one of the geocat projects, make reproduceable environments or don't if you don't need to. 

This repo is meant to be a way to archive and share scratch files internally. If there is any actual collaboration that needs done, this probably isn't the place.

This a place to drop stuff and link it to other people.
